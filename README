This is the README file for the EloCal package.

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  See the file COPYING for
details.

EloCal is a utility for calibrating touchmonitors made by ELO
Touchsystems using 'IntelliTouch' 2500S and 2500U controllers.  
Specifically, the program can be used to determine the calibration 
values to be inserted into the 'MinX=', 'MaxX=', 'MinY=' and 'MaxY=' 
directives of an 'InputDevice' section of the XF86Config(5) file for 
such a monitor.

Please see the 'INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

The package comes with two utilities:

1) EloCal
The calibration utility.  This can be invoked as follows:

    elocal <device>

where <device> is the name of the device file that references the
touch screen controller.  For serial touchscreens (IntelliTouch 2500S
controllers), this will be a tty device (e.g. '/dev/ttyS1').  For USB
touchscreens (IntelliTouch 2500U), this will be one of the generic
'input event' devices (e.g. '/dev/input/event0').


2) EloMon
A touchscreen event monitor.  This can be used to verify that a
touchscreen is working properly.  It is invoked as follows:

	    elomon <device> 

where <device> is the name of the device file that references the
touch screen controller.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
Be sure to disable any active touchscreen configuration in
XF86Config(5) before running either of these utilities.  Failure to do
so will produce inaccurate results.
