This is the installation file for the EloCal package.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building EloCal:

X11 Window System
Virtually all Linux distros should include this.

Qt Toolkit, v3.2 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this.  It's typically installed as part
of the KDE Desktop Environment, although KDE is by no means required.
It can also be downloaded directly from TrollTech (http://www.trolltech.com/).

Radio Library
Available from ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/libradio/.

Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is most often a matter of 
cd'ing to the top of the EloDev source tree and typing
'./configure', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those
who obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.


Good Luck!
